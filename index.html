        Having a chat with a stranger is a great way to learn new things. It
        helps you expand your world view and can be very entertaining. These
        interactions can teach you about different places and cultures other
        than your own. Sometimes talking with a stranger can be therapeutic.
        Hearing about the other person can take your mind off your problem.
        Since strangers don't know you, it can feel as though they are being
        less judmental when they listen to you. These reasons should encourage
        people to <a href="https://www.pokiecam.com/">stranger chat</a>
        whenever possible.  Anytime you can talk with someone you do not
        already know, both of you benefit. With all these great rewards it is
        hard to believe that we do not all go out of our way to talk with
        strangers.

      <h2>Tips for Chatting with Strangers</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes when trying to talk with people you do not know already it
        can be difficult. You might feel uncomforatble or think you do not have
        anyting in common with the other person. These feeling should not
        discourage you and they go away the more you practice. Here are a few
        tips that will help make your stranger chat better.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Smile</strong>, having a smile on you face spreads happines
          and joy in the world. Smiling increases your own happines and the
          happines of random strangers that you encounter throughout your day.
          If you habitually smile you will be more likely to attract people
          that want to converse. As a bonus, the strangers you will be
          attracting with this practice will be of high quality and your chat
          will be more uplifting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Say hello</strong>, sounds simple right? It is a simple thing
          to do for sure. It is also amazing how many people forget to say
          'Hi' when encountering a stranger. Saying hello to a stranger breaks
          the ice and shows them your interseted in having a converation.
          Taking this tiny bit of initiative will increase the amount of
          stranger chat in your life. After saying hello, the stranger you are
          starting to chat with will likey return the gesture and greet you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Say your name</strong> after introducing yourself. Tell the
          stranger your name. If you need too, ask for thiers as not everyone
          knows how important this is. People love hearing thier name. Durring
          a chat between to people, referring to eachother by name creates a
          stronger connection. This is a super powerful way to start building a
          connection with someone. People who take sales classes learn this
          technique for helping to start a chat with random people they meet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Establish rapport</strong> by finding some common ground. The
          more you chat you will begin to discover shared experiences. Those
          things you have in common are great to explore further in your
          conversation. Make sure to look the person in the eye an stay focused
          on what they are saying. There can be to much eye contact so pay
          attention to how much they are looking back and how much they are
          looking away. If the other person starts looking to the side it could
          be a sign that you need to just lession how much you are trying to
          look them in the eye.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Ask questions</strong> about each subject that comes up if
          you can think of them. Just remember to let them answer and two
          answer any questions they have for you. Good one on one conversations
          tend to have pretty equal ammounts of participation form each person.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Where to Stranger Chat</h2>
      <p>
        If you are looking for place to strike up a conversation with strangers
        we have you covered. Below are some places you can chat with people you
        have never met before.
      </p>
      <h3>Stranger Chat in Person</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Coffee Shops</strong>, good old coffee shops are great places
          to meet people and chat with them. You can look for signs that
          someone is willing to have a conversation. One good indication they
          will converse is if they are sitting alone and up right with nothing
          but a cup of coffee.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Grocery Stores</strong>, meeting people at grocery stores is farily easy. You
          can ask other patrons if an item tastes good or not. For example,
          "Have you tried this ice cream, is it good?" would be a great ice
          breaker. If you practice after a while you can be chatting up a storm
          about produce and tv dinners anytime you want.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Retail and Clothing Stores</strong>, You can chat with other
          customers or even the people working in these businesses. Striking up
          a conversation with a helpful clerk at a retail shop should be farily
          easy because these people are there to help you. You can ask just
          about anyone in a clothing store about what they think of a shirt and
          it may lead to a having a chat with that stranger.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
          <strong>Bars</strong>, these establishments are made for socializing
          which makes it pretty easy to chat with strangers. A word of caution
          here though, you the other person you chat with might be inebriated.
          If you are careful though, it's definitly possible to find people at
          bars that are more interested in talking to strangers then getting
          inebriated. In this case, going alone to a bar with a book is
          actually a known signal that you interested in meeting people. So
          definitly chat with the person you see in a bar alone with a book.
          </p>
